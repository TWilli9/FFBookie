# Fantasy Football League Bookie

Welcome to the **Fantasy Football League Bookie**! This project is designed to provide detailed standings, power rankings, matchup predictions, and advanced analytics for your fantasy football league using the `espn_api.football` library. It‚Äôs perfect for league commissioners or anyone who loves diving into the numbers behind their league.

---

## **Features**
- **Standings**: View team records, points for, points against, and points per game.
- **Power Rankings**: See how teams stack up based on ESPN's power rankings.
- **Matchup Predictions**: Get projected scores, predicted winners, and top players for each matchup.
- **Advanced Metrics**:
  - **PF/G**: Points For per Game.
  - **PA/G**: Points Against per Game.
  - **DIFF**: Points Differential per Game.
  - **Luck**: Measures how "lucky" or "unlucky" a team has been based on their points scored and allowed.
- **Customizable**: Easily add or remove metrics to suit your league's needs.

---

## **Setup**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Required Python libraries: `pandas` and `espn_api`.

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas espn-api
```

### **3. Configure League Credentials**
To connect to your ESPN league, you‚Äôll need the following:
- **League ID**: Found in the URL of your ESPN league page.
- **ESPN S2 Cookie**: A secure token for authentication.
- **SWID Cookie**: Another authentication token.

Replace the placeholders in the code with your league's credentials:

```python
league = League(
    league_id=12345678,  # Replace with your league ID
    year=2024,           # Replace with the current year
    espn_s2='YOUR_ESPN_S2_COOKIE',  # Replace with your ESPN S2 cookie
    swid='{YOUR_SWID_COOKIE}'        # Replace with your SWID cookie
)
```

### **4. Run the Script**
Save the script as `ffBookie.py` and run it using Python:

```bash
python ffBookie.py
```

## **How It Works**

### **1. Standings**
The script generates a standings table with the following columns:
- **Team Name**: The name of the fantasy team.
- **Record**: The team's win-loss record (e.g., 10-4).
- **Points For (PF)**: Total points scored by the team.
- **Points Against (PA)**: Total points allowed by the team.
- **PF/G**: Points For per Game.
- **PA/G**: Points Against per Game.
- **DIFF**: Points Differential per Game.
- **Power Ranking**: ESPN's power ranking for the team.
- **Expected Wins**: The number of wins the team "should" have based on their points scored and allowed.
- **Luck**: How "lucky" or "unlucky" the team has been (actual wins vs. expected wins).

### **2. Power Rankings**
The script pulls ESPN's power rankings for your league and displays them alongside the standings.

### **3. Matchup Predictions**
The `getMatchups` function provides detailed information about each matchup for a given week, including:
- **Home Team**: The home team in the matchup.
- **Away Team**: The away team in the matchup.
- **Projected Scores**: Projected scores for both teams.
- **Actual Scores**: Actual scores (if the matchup has been played).
- **Predicted Winner**: The team predicted to win based on projected scores.
- **Projected Margin**: The difference between projected scores.
- **Top Players**: The top 3 projected players for each team.

### **4. Advanced Metrics**
- **Luck**: Calculated using the Pythagorean expectation formula, adjusted for a 14-week season.
- **PF/G** and **PA/G**: Points For and Points Against per game, useful for comparing team performance over time.
