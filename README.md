## **Setup**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `espn_api`, and `matplotlib`.

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas espn-api matplotlib
```

### **3. Configure League Credentials**
To connect to your ESPN league, you'll need the following:

- League ID: Found in the URL of your ESPN league page.
- ESPN S2 Cookie: A secure token for authentication.
- SWID Cookie: Another authentication token.

Replace the placeholders in the code with your league's credentials:

```python
league = League(
    league_id=12345678,  # Replace with your league ID
    year=2024,           # Replace with the current year
    espn_s2='YOUR_ESPN_S2_COOKIE',  # Replace with your ESPN S2 cookie
    swid='{YOUR_SWID_COOKIE}'        # Replace with your SWID cookie
)
```

### **4. Run the Script**
Save the script as ffBookie.py and run it using Python:

```bash
python ffBookie.py
```

This will generate the following JSON files:
- matchups.json: Weekly matchup data.
- standings.json: Current standings data.
- historical.json: All-time historical data.

---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Standings**
The script generates a standings table with the following columns:

- Team Name: The name of the fantasy team.
- Record: The team's win-loss record (e.g., 10-4).
- Points For (PF): Total points scored by the team.
- Points Against (PA): Total points allowed by the team.
- PF/G: Points For per Game.
- PA/G: Points Against per Game.
- DIFF: Points Differential per Game.
- Power Ranking: ESPN's power ranking for the team.
- Expected Wins: The number of wins the team "should" have based on their points scored and allowed.
- Luck: How "lucky" or "unlucky" the team has been (actual wins vs. expected wins).
- SOS (Strength of Schedule): Average points scored by the team's opponents.

### **2. Matchup Predictions**
The getMatchups function provides detailed information about each matchup for a given week, including:

- Home Team: The home team in the matchup.
- Away Team: The away team in the matchup.
- Projected Scores: Projected scores for both teams.
- Actual Scores: Actual scores (if the matchup has been played).
- Predicted Winner: The team predicted to win based on projected scores.
- Projected Margin: The difference between projected scores.
- Top Players: The top 3 projected players for each team.

### **3. Historical Data**
The getAllTimeData function calculates all-time performance metrics for each team owner, including:

- All-Time Record: Total wins and losses.
- All-Time PF/G: Average points for per game.
- All-Time PA/G: Average points against per game.
- All-Time DIFF: Average points differential per game.
- All-Time Expected Wins: Total expected wins.
- All-Time Luck: Total luck over all seasons.

### **4. Interactive Dashboard**
The index.html file provides a web-based dashboard to visualize:

- Weekly Matchups: Projected scores, predicted winners, and top players.
- Current Standings: Team records, points for/against, and advanced metrics.
- Historical Data: All-time performance metrics for each team owner.

To use the dashboard:

1. Generate the JSON files by running ffBookie.py.
2. Open index.html in a web browser.
